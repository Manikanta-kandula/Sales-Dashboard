E-commerce Sales Data Visualization with AWS
Project Overview
This project showcases how to analyze and visualize e-commerce sales data using AWS cloud services. The sales dataset includes details like product categories, revenue, order volume, and customer demographics from an e-commerce platform.

By leveraging AWS tools, this project demonstrates a scalable and serverless approach to building data insights dashboards.

Architecture
The project uses the following AWS services:

Amazon S3 – Storage for raw sales data in CSV format

AWS Glue – For data cleaning, transformation, and cataloging

Amazon Athena – To query transformed data directly from S3 using SQL

Amazon QuickSight – For building interactive dashboards and visualizing trends

Features
Ingest and store raw sales data securely

Perform ETL (Extract, Transform, Load) with Glue

Query large datasets efficiently with Athena

Build charts, graphs, and key insights with QuickSight

Identify trends such as top-selling products, high-revenue periods, and regional performance

How to Use
Upload your dataset to an S3 bucket.

Create a Glue Data Catalog to define schema and run transformations.

Use Athena to run SQL queries on the data stored in S3.

Connect Athena to QuickSight to create visual dashboards.

Sample Insights
